A match from feature d1 in image 1 to feature d2 in image 2 is used only
if the distance between d1 and d2 is significantly smaller than the distance
to d1 and any other feature in image 2. The match needs to be significantly
better than any other potential match. "Significant" is defined by the threshold
that you pass to the VL_UBCMATCH function.


matches = []
For each descriptor k1 in image 1:
    closest_match_distance = Infinity
    second_closest_match_distance = Infinity
    best_match = None
    For each descriptor k2 in image 2:
        distance_squared = d(k1, k2)
        if (distance_squared < closest_match_distance):
            second_closest_match_distance = closest_match_distance
            closest_match_distance = distance_squared
            best_match = k2
    If (threshold * closest_match_distance <
      second_closest_match_distance AND best_match != None):
        matches.Insert((k1, best_match, closest_match_distance))
return matches
